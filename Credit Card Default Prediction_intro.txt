Introduction to the Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Credit Default dataset, which contains information about customers and whether they defaulted on a loan. The dataset includes the following columns:

Income: Annual income of the customer.
Age: Age of the customer.
Loan: Loan amount taken by the customer.
Loan to Income: Ratio of loan amount to annual income.
Default: Indicates if the customer defaulted on the loan (1 for Yes, 0 for No).
The dataset comprises 2000 entries, each representing a specific customer's financial attributes.

Project Description
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model to determine whether a customer will default on a loan based on their financial data. The project involves the following steps:

Data Import and Initial Exploration: Load the dataset and explore its properties such as shape, data types, and summary statistics.
Feature Selection and Target Definition: Identify the target variable (Default) and select relevant features (Income, Age, Loan, Loan to Income) for the predictive model.
Train-Test Split: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
Model Selection: Choose a Logistic Regression model for prediction.
Model Training: Train the model on the training data.
Prediction and Evaluation: Use the trained model to predict defaults on the test data and evaluate the model's performance using metrics like confusion matrix, accuracy score, and classification report.
