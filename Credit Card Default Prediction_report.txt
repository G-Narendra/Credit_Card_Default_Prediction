Model Training and Results

After defining the target variable (Default) and selecting relevant features (Income, Age, Loan, Loan to Income), the dataset was split into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets. A Logistic Regression model was chosen and trained on the training data.

The model training and prediction yielded the following results:

Predicted values: An array of predicted default values (0 or 1).
Model Evaluation

The performance of the model was evaluated using the following metrics:

Confusion Matrix:

[[506,  13],
 [ 17,  64]]
Accuracy Score: 0.95
Classification Report:

              precision    recall  f1-score   support

         0       0.97      0.97      0.97       519

weighted avg 0.95 0.95 0.95 600


These results indicate that the model has an accuracy of 95%, with a recall of 97% for "No Default" and 79% for "Default." The precision is higher for "No Default" (97%) compared to "Default" (83%).

**Conclusion**

The Logistic Regression model shows high performance in predicting loan defaults. The model's effectiveness can be attributed to the well-defined features and the simplicity of logistic regression. Further improvements could involve exploring additional features, tuning model parameters, or employing more complex algorithms to enhance predictive accuracy.
